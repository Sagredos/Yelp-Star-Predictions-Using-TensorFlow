# Yelp-Star-Predictions-Using-TensorFlow

Predicted businesses star rating based on all review text for that business using neural network implementations
in TenserFlow. Yelp data was imported and converted to pandas dataframes and a tf-idf vectorizer was utilized
to convert text data into a numerical value based on text relevancy. Using these tf-idf scores, TensorFlow and
Sklearn could use the numerical data to make an accurate prediction based on text.
